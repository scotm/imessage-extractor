Would you consider a few one-off runs with me - paid, obviously. Parkruns are very lovely things, but for all the slow as heck runners, everyone is an island, and all you can really think about is “everyone’s so much faster than me, and I really could just be in my bed right now.”

That - and the first kilometre is definitely the hardest. I think there’s a reason for that - a sudden rush of 500+ bodies making “lol-fuck-you” pace, invariably I’m swept up, andI push myself too hard and the next three are a slog.

An occasional coach - company, kicking my arse and someone who intimately knows running and being suitably helpful has value to me, basically.

I do ask CMG to do one a week with me on Saturdays. But given the run club may have so few turning up, my guess would be that it’s not going to be a regular staple. (Unless someone really very wonderful _insists_.)",RCS,,,

When I said your “body is your mealticket”, I understand that was a crude and oversimplified way of describing what you do. And I should clarify those potentially ill-chosen words.

* it is an impressive body. (Some of the PG OTers are more fond of posting their thirst traps to gather business than actually how much better it feels and how much your life is going to get better to be stronger and fitter)
* you have made your body do very impressive things, national competition, healthy lifting skills and more
* you coach people and make them welcome, regardless of ability, skill or fitness
* and, even from a single session, you set reasonable expectations, meet them where they are, and respect the individual.

As for healthy mind, there was a lovely placard at the New York Marathon this year - “instead of this punishment, you could have gone to therapy!”

I don’t have a healthy mind. Or at least, not all the time. Anxiety can be sodding crippling. Pills (a modest dose of sertraline) does help, lifting and running are good for focus and feeling better and glowy for hours. But it does creep up.

For many years, anxiety became my constant companion. It would regularly take over completely - emotional paralysis, and avoiding situations (ones where pleasure and growth were likely) rather than risk breaking.

But, cutting to the chase. I truly don’t mind if on reflection and honesty, I wouldn’t be a good fit for your approach towards training. There will be no hard feelings, and if nothing else, it’s been good to think about the really rather important reasons why I picked this hobby up, beyond disgust, why I want to learn this new skill, build my aerobic fitness, keep my strength and also the feeling that I get a lot out of it. And how consistency, community (my fit pals are amazing - but they’re not experts) , kindness, calendars, progressive overload and habit-forming has transformed my relationship with exercise and my body.

I’ll keep going with gradual improvements and challenges. Maybe find a local running community - once I feel like my easy runs are actually easy, haha! That could take eight weeks as neuroplasticity, lung and heart health rises, or it could take years to happen.

It’s nice to reflect and no longer see it as a domain in my mind and body - less filled with trauma, and more at one with peace and healing.

Morgan (the dude in the red shirt)\xa0moved to Leith for a while. He took me for my first 5k parkrun in November.

Him talking, distracting me from burning lungs, sore calves, reconsidering all\xa0life choices that led to those moments. And after completing the course, we sat on a bench and spent an hour sipping water, eating a few sugary things to help recover and listen to one another.

Equally, it's also been nice to take Morgan to PureGym Ocean Terminal and introduce him into learning to lift weights with safety and skill. He’s moved to Gorgie - about two months ago, and we keep in touch -  but after eight months of consistency and care, he's got a pleasing muscular sleeper build - and has continued his regular running protocol. As for mental health, I will choose my words carefully.

I may be a less than optimal judge of character, but I believe he has blossomed into an inwardly confident, emotionally healthy\xa0man. An organic intellectual wise beyond his years.

Something my pal Connor Beaton (he’s never ran before, but ran with me for the Pride 5k) once said about being the “personification of a safe space” for people going through tough times has really stuck with me. I’ve tried to make that part of how I show up for my friends—just being there, being someone they feel comfortable talking to when life gets hard.

That brings me to a little white lie I told, which, if I’m being honest, was a bit of a dick move—but for a good cause.

Morgan, who as I’ve said is really into running, had just gone through a rough breakup—the first big one, the kind that shakes you up. I could sense he needed a friend, but I also know both of us are experts at dodging real conversations when we’re hurting. We’ll find any excuse to keep things light and avoid talking about what’s actually going on.

So, I decided to cheat the system a bit. I asked Morgan if he’d come with me to my first parkrun, framing it as though I really needed his support. In reality, I wasn’t that fussed about running at the time (though now I genuinely love it), but I knew he wouldn’t turn me down if he thought he was helping me out. It was my way of getting us together, giving him a chance to talk without making it into a big, awkward “let’s have a serious chat” moment.

Looking back, I’m honestly glad I stretched the truth. That run gave us time together, Morgan got some stuff off his chest, and we ended up even closer as mates. Plus, the twist? I actually ended up enjoying running, and now it’s become a regular thing for me — I pester CMG about it, and now I’m asking you.

So, was it a bit immoral? Probably. But in the end, I’d do it again the same way. Sometimes a little nudge (or a well-placed fib) is what it takes to help a friend when they need it most.",RCS,,,

That route hits the: try to jog/run 5k at pace -plus 20min requirements in the prescribed workout plan. It’s around 7km total on a slight gradient, I will find it demanding. Therefore, I suspect I will find a consecutive day Tuesday morning session excessively so.

There’s a really lovely PT, therapist and Scottish queer historian, Dominic Graham - who’s been a total babe. Lives in Fife, and a rather lovely dude to chat to about living a nice gay, anti-fascist and fit life.

An autistic queer PT in Glasgow, Jordan Fleming. Coaches women martial arts and boxing, in a big garage. Been trying to convince him to reach out and talk to the local Living Rent branch.

If you’re up in Fountainbridge, the former Labour Party councillor Ross McKenzie might be a good community contact to chat to about building a community fitness group. Straight, but well-connected and generally very lovely, I like him a lot.",RCS,,,
